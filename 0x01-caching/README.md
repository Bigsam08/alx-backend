# Caching system temporaily stores frequent access data so it can be retrived more quickly
providing faster access to data

# FIFO - [ First In First Out ] this is a cashing method where the oldest data in the cache is removed First
when a new data entry is stored.

# LIFO - [ Last In First Out ] is the caching method where the latest data stored is the first to be removed for the new data entry to be stored

# LRU - [ Least Recently Used ] this method removes the least recently used items first. it assumes the data is not importantly needed

# MRU [ Most Recent Used] it's the opposite of LRU, this method removes the recently used data for a new data entry

# LFU [ Least Frequently Used ] 

## 
# caching limits
- Memory size
- Complexity : effecting evition policies like LRU, FIFO can be Complex
- Offset
