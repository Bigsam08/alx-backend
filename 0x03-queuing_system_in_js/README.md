# Redis (Remote Dictionary Server) is an open-source, in-memory key-value data store that is used primarily for caching,
# data storage, and message brokering. 
# It is known for its high performance, flexibility, and support for various data structures.

# In-memory storage: Redis stores data in memory rather than on disk, making it extremely fast for read and write operations. 
# While it can be configured for persistence, its primary strength lies in in-memory data storage.
